        <h2 class="summary">About Me</h2>
        <p class="description">I'm from Berkeley, CA, but I grew up in Bethesda,
          MD, moving halfway through highschool. I'm so glad I moved–I love the
          west coast (the weather and hiking) and the opportunities I had here
          during the last half of high school, especially playing and touring
          with the Berkeley High jazz ensemble.</p>

        <h2>Why Dali?</h2>
        <p class="description">I can stay focused on a coding project for hours straight, drawn along
          by the satisfaction of solving one small problem after another. I love
          the feeling of building something useful and usable, and the DALI lab
          would provide me constant opportunities to do so. Applying skills I’ve
          learned in classes is in itself a skill, one which I hope to gain
          through DALI. I also hope to meet more people who, like me, are
          interested in CS, as I’ve found that people who share my interests are
          the ones most fun to befriend.
